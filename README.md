# C0_Gromov_Hausdorff_distance

In paper ,  they have motivation behind this work is to provide an understanding of the classical Gromov-Hausdorff metric by extending it to maps between metric spaces. Second, they wish to highlight some fundamental aspects of research that are often overlooked in dynamics: the analysis of long-time behavior through Walter's concept of topological stability. Indeed, they propose to combine the Gromov-Hausdorff metric with the standard distance between maps of metric spaces. Next, they studied topological GH-stability inspired by the Walters' topological stability.
